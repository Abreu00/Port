        `Hi! My name is Fábio de Abreu, I was born in Florianópolis/SC Brazil,
      and I'm currently part of Directa Automação team, working with
      Front-end development. Nevertheless, also developing projects for
      myself and others.`,
        `My journey to learn programming started when I was 16 years old, it
      felt like the natural thing to do for someone passionate about
      technology. Later, I had some experience with formal education,
      studying Computer Science at UFSC. However, I believe that the best
      way to learn is through working on real projects and creating software
      that helps people.`

        Brazilian industrial sector, using vanilla JS and also facebook React library which has become 
        my go-to tool for developing web sites like this one you are browsing.`
